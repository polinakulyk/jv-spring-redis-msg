# jv-spring-redis-msg
Following the official Spring guide on using Spring Data Redis to publish and subscribe to messages sent with Redis. It
provides not only a NoSQL data store but a messaging system as well. The receiver is counting the messages received - 
that way it can signal when it has received a message. Source: https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-redis/
